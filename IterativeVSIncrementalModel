ðŸ”„ Iterative Model
Focus: Refinement through repetition
Approach: Develop a working version of the software and continuously improve it through repeated cycles (iterations).
Goal: Enhance the same product version based on feedback and testing.
Process: Each iteration includes planning, design, coding, testing, and evaluation.
Output: A progressively refined version of the same system.

Example:
You build a basic version of a photo editing app, then improve its performance, UI, and features in each cycle.

âž• Incremental Model
Focus: Gradual expansion of functionality
Approach: Build the software in small, functional pieces (increments), each adding new capabilities.
Goal: Deliver parts of the system step-by-step until the full product is complete.
Process: Each increment is developed and tested independently, then integrated.
Output: A growing system with new features added in each stage.

Example:
You first release a login module, then add photo upload, then editing tools, and finally sharing features.

Feature	                        Iterative Model	                                         Incremental Model
Development Style	Repeated refinement of the same version	                 Step-by-step addition of new features
Feedback Integration	       After each iteration	                                After each increment
Delivery	           Partial but evolving product	                      Functional modules added progressively
Risk Handling	             Early feedback reduces risk	                    Modular delivery isolates risk
Use Case	          Projects with evolving requirements	               Projects needing early partial delivery
