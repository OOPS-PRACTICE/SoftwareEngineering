üîç Key Differences Between Incremental and Agile Models
Feature	                                       Incremental Model	                                        Agile Model
Approach	                         Builds software in fixed increments	                    Builds software in short, iterative cycles (sprints)
Flexibility	               Less flexible; changes are harder once increments are planned	  Highly flexible; embraces changes even late in development
Customer Involvement	          Limited; feedback usually after each increment	          High; customers collaborate throughout the process
Delivery	               Final product delivered after all increments are complete	        Working software delivered after every sprint
Planning	                 Detailed upfront planning for each increment	                     Adaptive planning; evolves with feedback
Team Structure	                    Traditional roles (PM, devs, testers)	                       Cross-functional, self-organizing teams
Focus	                              Functionality added in stages	                           Value delivered continuously with customer feedback
üß† Summary
Incremental Model is like building a house room by room, with a blueprint fixed early on.

Agile Model is like designing a house with the owner present, adjusting the plan as their needs evolve.

If you're working on a project with stable requirements, incremental might work well. But if you're dealing with changing needs or uncertain goals, Agile is your best friend
