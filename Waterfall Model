🌊 The Waterfall Model: A Classic SDLC Approach
The Waterfall Model is one of the earliest and most traditional frameworks within the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It follows a linear and sequential progression, where each phase must be fully completed before moving on to the next. The term "waterfall" reflects the downward flow through distinct stages—much like cascading water.

✅ Key Characteristics
Clear Milestones Unlike iterative or Agile methodologies, the Waterfall Model emphasizes comprehensive upfront planning. Requirements and design are defined early and remain largely unchanged throughout development.

Single Approval Cycle Each phase produces well-defined deliverables—such as requirement documents, design diagrams, and test plans. Stakeholders approve each phase once, minimizing mid-project scope changes.

Structured Execution Ideal for projects with stable and well-understood requirements, where minimal changes are expected during development.

Though more rigid than modern approaches, the Waterfall Model can be highly effective when project needs—such as those in academic or institutional settings—are clearly defined from the outset.

📋 Phases of the Waterfall Model
Phase	Duration	Description
Requirements Analysis	2–4 weeks	Gather and document all system requirements from stakeholders.
System Design	3–5 weeks	Develop system architecture and design, including HLD and LLD specifications.
Implementation (Coding)	5–8 weeks	Write and integrate code based on design documents.
Integration & Testing	2–4 weeks	Combine modules and test the system as a whole. Fix any identified defects.
Deployment	1–2 weeks	Deliver the final product to the production environment or end users.
Maintenance	Ongoing	Provide updates, bug fixes, and enhancements post-deployment.

👍 Advantages
Straightforward and easy to manage
Clearly defined stages and deliverables
Well-suited for small projects with fixed requirements

👎 Disadvantages
Inflexible to changes once development begins
Not ideal for long-term or evolving projects
High risk of late-stage issues due to delayed testing

🕒 When to Use the Waterfall Model
Requirements are clear, stable, and well-documented
The project is short-term and uncomplicated
Technology stack is familiar and predictable
No ambiguity or frequent changes are expected

⏳ Estimated Timeline
For moderately scoped projects, a typical Waterfall cycle spans 14–16 weeks from initial planning to production launch. However, complex systems or large-scale integrations may require 
additional time in any phase.
