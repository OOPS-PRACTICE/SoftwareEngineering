Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC) :

üõ†Ô∏è Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC): A Strategic Framework
The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) serves as a comprehensive blueprint for delivering high-quality software in a structured and reliable manner. 
By dividing the project into distinct phases and adopting an appropriate development model‚Äîsuch as Waterfall, Agile, or Spiral‚Äîorganizations can optimize resource allocation, 
reduce risks, and maintain consistent quality from initial concept to long-term support.

SDLC is a disciplined methodology used by software development teams to plan, build, test, and deploy robust software solutions. 
It ensures that the final product aligns with customer expectations, remains cost-effective, and is delivered within the desired timeframe.

üîÑ Core Phases of the SDLC
Planning & Feasibility Analysis :
Define project objectives, scope, and potential challenges
Evaluate technical and financial feasibility (budget, timeline, resources)
Develop an initial roadmap and success criteria

Requirements Gathering & Analysis :
Collaborate with stakeholders to capture both functional and non-functional needs
Document clear specifications or user stories to guide development

Design :
Convert requirements into a detailed technical blueprint or system architecture
Outline data models, interfaces, and workflows
Share design documentation with developers and stakeholders

Implementation (Coding) :
Developers write and integrate code based on the design specifications
Incorporate practices like code reviews, version control, and continuous integration

Testing :
Verify that the software meets requirements and performs as intended
Conduct various tests: unit, integration, system, performance, and user acceptance
Identify and resolve defects before release

Deployment :
Launch the software into the production environment or distribute it to users
May include final setup, user training, and documentation handover

Maintenance :
Address bugs, implement enhancements, and roll out updates post-deployment
Ensure the software remains secure, scalable, and aligned with evolving user needs
