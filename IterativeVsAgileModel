Feature	                                  Iterative Model	                                                         Agile Model
Development Approach	   Repeated refinement of a single system through cycles (iterations)	      Incremental delivery of working software in short cycles (sprints)
Timeline Structure	          Iterations typically last 2â€“6 weeks	                                        Sprints usually last 1â€“4 weeks
Planning	           Initial planning followed by refinement in each iteration	                     Continuous planning before each sprint
User Involvement	       Feedback is gathered after each iteration	                            High user involvement with feedback after every sprint
Flexibility	           Moderate flexibility; changes are incorporated in future iterations	              High flexibility; changes can be made even mid-sprint
Testing	                         Testing occurs at the end of each iteration	                            Testing is integrated throughout each sprint
Documentation	                         More structured and formal	                                            Lightweight and adaptive
Team Roles	                       Project Manager and Developers	                                  Scrum Master, Product Owner, Development Team
Delivery	               Final product delivered after multiple iterations	                 Working software delivered at the end of each sprint
Best For	           Projects with evolving requirements but needing structure	              Projects requiring rapid delivery and frequent changes
