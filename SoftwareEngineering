What is Software Engineering ?

Software engineering is a structured and methodical discipline focused on the design, development, testing, and upkeep of software systemsâ€”such as applications, websites, and computer programs. 
It relies on established principles, processes, methodologies, tools, and best practices to ensure quality and efficiency throughout the software lifecycle.

How to Use Software Engineering ? 

Software engineering follows a series of well-defined stages to ensure successful software creation:

Requirements: Identify and clarify what the software is expected to accomplish.
Design: Strategize the structure, appearance, and behavior of the software.
Implementation: Convert the design into functional code.
Testing: Validate that the software performs as intended and is free of critical issues.
Deployment: Launch the software for user access and interaction.
Maintenance: Continuously improve, update, and fix the software as needed.

Stake Holders in Software Development ?

Developers: Those who write the software code.
Testers (QA): Responsible for quality assurance.
Project Managers: Oversee the project's progress.
Executives and Decision-Makers: Provide strategic direction and resources.
Customers: The individuals or organizations purchasing the software.
End-Users: The people who directly interact with the software.
Investors: Provide financial backing for the project.
Product Manager : Defines the product vision and overall strategy. Gathers and prioritizes requirements, often working closely with users and other stakeholders to shape the product backlog.
Scrum Master : Plans, organizes and monitors the projects's schedule, scope and budget.
Business Analysts : Elicit and document software requirements, often stakeholder interviews and process analysis. Serve as a liaison between business units and the technical team, clarifying needs and constraints.
Subject Matter Experts (SMEs): Possess deep knowledge of the domain or industry where the software is deployed. Advise on domain-specific requirements, regulations, or best pratices
Operations/DevOps/System Administrators: Manage infrastructure, deployment pipelines, and production environments.
Maintenance and support team : Provide ongoing support to address issues post-launch.
Regulators: Government bodies or industry organizations that set standards. like data protection regulations.
